            <h2>About NRIs Resource Hub</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Hello, and welcome to our site!</strong> If you’ve found yourself here, you might be wondering what exactly an NRI is and how it relates to you or your loved ones.</p>
        
            <h3>Who or What is an NRI?</h3>
            <p><strong>NRI</strong> stands for Non-Resident Indian. In simple terms, an NRI is an Indian citizen who resides outside of India for purposes such as employment, business, or education. The definition of an NRI is primarily used in the context of taxation and financial regulations.</p>
        
            <h3>Key Criteria for Being an NRI:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duration of Stay:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are considered an NRI if you have spent less than 182 days in India during the financial year.</li>
                        <li>Alternatively, if you have spent 365 days or more in India in the past four years, but less than 60 days in the current financial year, you would also qualify as an NRI.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Purpose of Stay Abroad:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Employment or taking up a business outside India.</li>
                        <li>Education or training.</li>
                        <li>Any other purpose that requires an extended stay outside India.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Why It Matters:</h3>
            <p>Being classified as an NRI affects how you manage your finances, pay taxes, and maintain your legal responsibilities in India. It also opens up specific banking options, such as NRE and NRO accounts, which are designed to cater to the financial needs of NRIs.</p>
